# DpRam Library 
The DpRam is a behavioral model for a DPRAM/BRAM.
It also includes a DpRamManager verification component to
drive the interface to the DpRam behavioral model. 

## Testbenches are Included 

Testbenches are in the Git repository, so you can 
run a simulation and see a live example 
of how to use the models.
